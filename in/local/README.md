This is a place for other inputs to the fuzzer besides what we
destribute in hadron-sclang/fuzzer. Git is configured to ignore
every other file and folder put into this folder, so you can add
lots of stuff without having to worry about the distribution
licende of the code.

Common things to copy in here include:

* The SuperCollider class library
* Code from Quarks
* Sclang code from other projects

All will be useful input to the fuzzer!
